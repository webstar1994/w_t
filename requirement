        They will sign up with their wallet address. 
        Members will only receive BUSD rewards when they stake their H2O in the H2O-BUSD liquidity pool in Pancake Swap.(BSCscan Query Wallet addresses in Pancake Swap H2O-BUSD liquidity pool with an member’s wallet address to determine that they are staking their H2O in H2O-BUSD liquidity Pool in Pancake Swap) 
        This creates liquidity and token holders can earn three ways:
            *BUSD rewards from all buy/sell in contract, 
            *0.17% paid in CAKE for providing the liquidity reward for transactions in the H2O/BUSD liquidity pool, 
            *and farming their CAKE LP Tokens in Pancake Swap

        50% of tokens are used to create an H2O-BUSD liquidity pool.

      (Already in Contract) 
    - A 4% transaction fee is deposited in the H2O-BUSD liquidity pool in Pancake Swap  
      (already in contract, We need to change the address to the Pancake Swap liquidity pool.)
    - 3% of the transaction fee is sent to the Water Fund, 
      A public wallet that holds the funds for the water projects that are voted on. 
      (2% is in the contract called buyback Wallet. 1 % is in the contract as marketing.)
